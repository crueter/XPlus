# X+

Twitter/X Userscript

This does not work in Firefox and its derivatives. Use a Chromium-based browser such as [Brave](https://brave.com) instead.

# Installation

1. Install one userscript manager extension
   - [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/) (Preferred)
   - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php)
2. Open [this link](https://reino08.github.io/XPlus/X+.user.js) and press install
3. Install any optional addons

# Addons

Optional addons that are not in the core script due to potentially undesirable behavior or increased system load.

## Userlists ([Download](https://reino08.github.io/XPlus/X+.userlists.user.js))

Adds lists of users with custom styling. Currently only supports the Shinigami Eyes lists.
